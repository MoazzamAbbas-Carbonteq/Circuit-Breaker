# Circuit-Breaker

This repository contains the implementation and documentation of a Circuit Breaker pattern for managing fault tolerance in centralized and distributed systems.

# Features

Implements Circuit Breaker pattern to handle failures and timeouts in centralized systems.
Manages transitions between CLOSED, OPEN, and HALF_OPEN states.

# Note

Currently, the Circuit Breaker implementation supports centralized systems. In future versions, support for distributed systems will be added, including features such as:

Distributed state management for the circuit breaker.
Enhanced monitoring and metrics aggregation across multiple nodes.
Coordination between services in different environments.
Stay tuned for updates as we work on adding these features!
